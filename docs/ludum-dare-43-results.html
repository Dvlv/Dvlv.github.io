      <p>If you didn't read my previous post on LD43, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dvlv.co.uk/overtime-ludum-dare-43-post-mortem.html">check it out here.</a></p>
<p>The Ludum Dare results came in, and I managed to break top 100 in two categories!
There were apparently 506 ranked entries for the Compo.</p>
<p>My results were:</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: <strong>144</strong> th (3.645 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong>: <strong>291</strong> st (3.129 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: <strong>157</strong> th (3.419 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong>: <strong>55</strong> th (4.113 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Graphics</strong>: <strong>366</strong> th (2.871 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong>: <strong>365</strong> th (2.306 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Mood</strong>: <strong>60</strong> th (3.806 average from 33 ratings)</p>
<p>I'm very happy with these results. Now my goal for next time is obvious - I must break top 50 somewhere!</p>
<div class="section" id="where-i-did-well-theme-and-mood">
<h2>Where I did well - Theme and Mood</h2>
<p>No real surprises there to be honest. The game was based on a sad story, thus had quite a strong mood. The story was also based entirely around the
theme, to the point of literally having the theme as a piece of dialogue in both endings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-i-didn-t-do-so-well-graphics-and-audio">
<h2>Where I didn't do so well - Graphics and Audio</h2>
<p>Can't say I'm surprised there either. As mentioned in the previous post, my graphics were hand-drawn onto paper with coloured markers, then &quot;scanned&quot;
in with a phone app. This is probably not to everyone's taste (and I can't really draw as well as I tend to think I can).</p>
<p>Audio was the absolute last thing I added, and I had struggles with getting Audacity to play ball. A few commenters mentioned that some subtle
background music may have helped, and I completely agree. I wasn't in the mood to tackle a brand new challenge late on submission day, so decided
that no BGM would be better than terrible BGM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-next">
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>Before next time I'm going to try my hand at some music generation. I've had a play with <a class="reference external" href="https://beepbox.co">beepbox</a> in the past but
not in very much depth. I plan to have a try at using it to make some unobtrusive background melodies so that my next game will be a bit less
quiet (and perhaps moodier).</p>
<p>Artwork is something I have always struggled with during my attempts to make games. Pixel art is the only sort of computer art I don't entirely
suck at, so perhaps I'll use it for my next game jam. The choice of hand-drawn this time was entirely spontaneous (and I thought it <em>might</em>
give me a bit of a boost for being novelty) yet not successful enough for me to try again.</p>
