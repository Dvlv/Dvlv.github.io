    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>My first job out of university was entirely LAMP, using Zend framework. However, I had always loved writing python, and when it came time to leave that job I was mainly looking for something which would let me use it.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, recruiters were slightly sceptical of my lack of industry experience and would often ask me to prove my knowledge with a sort of &quot;phone pop-quiz&quot;. I think I went through about six of these in total.</p>
<p>This post will go through all questions which I can remember in a rough order of how often I had to answer them, with the best answer I can come up with (or link to).
If you are preparing for an entry-level job interview this should hopefully come in handy.</p>
<p>Anything in brackets will be my personal thoughts, not part of the answer.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-tuple-and-a-list">
<h2>What is the difference between a tuple and a list?</h2>
<p>A tuple is immutable, which means it cannot be edited after creation. A list is mutable, which means it CAN be edited.</p>
<p>Potential bonus points: A tuple is usually used to store grouped but dissimilar data, whereas a list typically stores similar data. E.g. when processing people's measurements, you may store all of a single person's measurements in a tuple, but when comparing multiple people's shoe sizes you would store them in a list.</p>
<p><em>(I was asked this by EVERY interviewer).</em></p>
<p><em>(I was also asked &quot;What error do you get if you try to mutate a tuple&quot; once. Answer is</em> <tt class="docutils literal">TypeError</tt> <em>for python 2.7 and 3.7)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-and-a-method">
<h2>What is the difference between a function and a method?</h2>
<p>A method belongs to a Class. A function does not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-static-method">
<h2>What is a static method?</h2>
<p>A function which belongs to a class but does not require access to its attributes.</p>
<p><em>(I was asked this almost every time, and it was always followed by: )</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-would-you-use-a-static-method-over-a-function">
<h2>Why would you use a static method over a function?</h2>
<p>To keep it near where it would be used, which makes large projects easier to understand.</p>
<p><em>(Most people who asked about static methods also asked about class methods next.)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-class-method-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-static-method">
<h2>What is a class method and how is it different from a static method?</h2>
<p>A class method acts on a class, whereas a regular method acts upon an instance of a class. Class methods take &quot;cls&quot; as their first argument (the class itself), regular methods take &quot;self&quot; (the instance) and static methods have no standard first argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-generator">
<h2>What is a generator?</h2>
<p>A function which uses the <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> keyword to return values as required, so that the entire list of results is not in memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-generator">
<h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a generator?</h2>
<p>Advantage: All results are not stored in memory, so a smaller amount needed.</p>
<p>Disadvantage: Results are consumed once returned, so you need to explicitly save any results you need more than once.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-decorator">
<h2>What is a decorator?</h2>
<p>A function which &quot;wraps&quot; another function, allowing it to execute code before and after the wrapped function runs.</p>
<p><em>(Once I was then asked &quot;So why would you use a decorator?&quot;. I basically repeated the previous answer.)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-metaclass">
<h2>What is a metaclass?</h2>
<p>A class which is used to create other classes. The best answer(s) can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-are-metaclasses-in-python">What are metaclasses in python?</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-three-main-keywords-for-error-handling">
<h2>What are the three main keywords for Error handling?</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Try</tt> - The code which may throw an error.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Except</tt> - What to do if there is an error.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Finally</tt> - Only executed if there is not an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-you-run-code-in-parallel">
<h2>How can you run code in parallel?</h2>
<p><em>(Something like that, but I think it was worded better)</em></p>
<p>You can use the <tt class="docutils literal">Threading</tt> module to run code in multiple threads, or the <tt class="docutils literal">multiprocessing</tt> module to use multiple processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-thread-safety">
<h2>What is thread safety?</h2>
<p><em>(Not really python specific but I was asked it at least twice.)</em></p>
<p>If something is thread safe then no two threads will operate on the same bit of data unexpectedly, which can cause unforseen errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-list-comprehension">
<h2>What is a list comprehension?</h2>
<p><em>(I was asked this once, I know what it is but its not something you can easily explain on the phone... )</em></p>
<p>You create a list on a single line of code using a for loop and sometimes an if statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-do-a-switch-statement-in-python">
<h2>How do you do a switch statement in python?</h2>
<p><em>(Sneaky sneaky)</em></p>
<p>You can't, just use <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">elif</tt>.</p>
