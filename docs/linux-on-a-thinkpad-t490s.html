      <p>My work laptop was recently due for an upgrade, and after careful deliberation, I landed on
a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/ThinkPad-T490s/p/22TP2TT490S">Thinkpad T490s.</a> Compared to my previous
E570, it was a huge upgrade. The specs are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Size</strong> : 14 Inch</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong> : 1.49 KG</li>
<li><strong>CPU</strong> : i7-8665U</li>
<li><strong>RAM</strong> : 16 GB DDR4</li>
<li><strong>Drive</strong> : 256 GB M.2 SSD</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="linux-experience">
<h2>Linux Experience</h2>
<p>Perfect. I am using OpenSuse Leap 15.1 and had absolutely no problems with Wi-fi, Bluetooth or Sleep. I haven't tried to Hibernate, it boots fast enough
that I can't see any reason to bother.</p>
<p>I was also given a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/accessories-and-monitors/docking/universal-cable-docks-thunderbolt/Thunderbolt-Dock-Gen-2-US/p/40AN0135US">Thinkpad Dock 2</a>
which works fine out-of-the-box with OpenSuse Leap and Plasma 5.</p>
<p>The laptop is powerful enough to handle all of my daily work, and when I'm forced to use PHPStorm it indexes a LOT faster than my old machine.</p>

<div class="section" id="general-thoughts">
<h2>General thoughts</h2>
<p>The laptop is over 1KG lighter than my previous 15 inch E570, and the screen size difference is barely noticeable. The screen resits glare a
lot better than previously, making it easy to see even under harsh office lights.</p>
<p>I haven't typed a <em>lot</em> on the keyboard, since I've become a bit of a mechanical keyboard snob, but the few times I have used it have been a
pleasant experience. I honestly think it's the best laptop keyboard I've used. The keys have a lot of travel and a fairly satisfying click.</p>
<p>A brilliant feature of some newer thinkpads is the &quot;ThinkShutter&quot;, which is a small sliding cover over the webcam. Some people at
my workplace have stickers stuck over their webcams, which looks a bit silly. I don't need to bother, since I can just leave the shutter closed.
There's even a small red dot on it so you can easily tell that it's shut.</p>
<p>I haven't had it long enough to do a full &quot;review&quot; of it, and I care more about software than hardware, so that's pretty much the extent of my
thoughts on the T490s for now. I can say with certainty that I <strong>would</strong> recommend this as a linux-powered work machine for someone who wants a
light laptop with a great keyboard.</p>
