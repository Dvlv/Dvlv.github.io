    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>A while back I wrote a blog post about switching from JetBrains IDEs to vim. In that blog post I
explained my rationale and went over my <tt class="docutils literal">vimrc</tt> file.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, and I'm writing another blog post as I've switched editors again - sort of.</p>
<div class="section" id="from-vim-to-neovim">
<h2>From Vim to Neovim</h2>
<p>So, why the switch? Mainly for one specific Plugin - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">Conquer of Completion</a></p>
<p>This plugin describes itself as &quot;Intellisense for Neovim&quot;. It provides a myriad of useful
features, but mainly autocomplete popups, and seamless integration with other fantastic addons
to a text editor, such as emmet and jedi.</p>
<p>While the <tt class="docutils literal">.vimrc</tt> file isn't <em>quite</em> just a copy-paste job to get neovim up to speed, enough
of it was transferrable to make the switch pretty painless (especially compared to the JetBrains -&gt; Vim switch).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-new-init-vim">
<h2>My new Init.vim</h2>
<p>As I went over my <tt class="docutils literal">vimrc</tt> file in the last post, I suppose I should go over my <tt class="docutils literal">init.vim</tt> in this post.</p>
<p>A lot of it ported straight over, so I'll mostly be going over the plugins I have to make neovim a pleasant
IDE experience.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Plug <span class="s1">&#39;neoclide/coc.nvim&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> {<span class="s1">&#39;branch&#39;</span>: <span class="s1">&#39;release&#39;</span>}
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;Shougo/deoplete.nvim&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> { <span class="s1">&#39;do&#39;</span>: <span class="s1">&#39;:UpdateRemotePlugins&#39;</span> }
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;deoplete-plugins/deoplete-jedi&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First off, the aforementioned Coc, which enables the use of a language-server background, as well
as linting and emmet support. Along with Coc comes Jedi, a must-have for python development. It acts
as a language server and offers the ability to jump around the codebase and view definitions for functions
as I write.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Plug <span class="s1">&#39;jaxbot/semantic-highlight.vim&#39;</span>
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;cloudhead/neovim-fuzzy&#39;</span>
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;mileszs/ack.vim&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This set of plugins carries over functionality which I got used to from my days using KDevelop to write PHP.</p>
<p>Semantic highlighting was talked about in my previous post, and is something I cannot code without
anymore.</p>
<p>Fuzzy allows me to bring up a list of all files in the project folder with a shortcut - Ctrl+Q - and
then do a fuzzy search. This allows me to quickly open a file, say <tt class="docutils literal">web/admin/templates/products/product_search_form.html</tt>
by simply hitting Ctrl+Q and typing &quot;te/prosea&quot;. Functionality like this is invaluable for navigating
quickly around a project.</p>
<p>Ack, as mentioned before, is like a project-wide find.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Plug <span class="s1">&#39;ObserverOfTime/coloresque.vim&#39;</span>
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;tpope/vim-surround&#39;</span>
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;unblevable/quick-scope&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Coloresque highlights colour strings (like &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;#ff6600&quot;) with their colour, so that you can see
at a glance what they are referring to.</p>
<p>Surround allows me to surround some amount of text with quotes, brackets or html tags.</p>
<p>Quickscope is something I don't get a huge amount of use from, but it is sometimes nice. It will highlight
a character in all words on the cursor's current line with the quickest way to jump to that word.
It's a bit hard to explain in text, so check out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/unblevable/quick-scope">the repo</a> for
a graphical demonstration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Plug <span class="s1">&#39;pangloss/vim-javascript&#39;</span>
Plug <span class="s1">&#39;tpope/vim-fugitive&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Vim-javascript provides nicer syntax highlighting abilities for javascript files. Not much to explain there.</p>
<p>Fugitive is a git integration which seems rather nice on paper. The problem is I'm much too used to quitting
my editor and using git from the command line, so I don't use it as much as I would think I should.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary-of-my-experience">
<h2>Summary of my experience</h2>
<p>Now that I have the power of intellisense in neovim, I don't think there's anything at all that I could
do with Pycharm, or any other graphical IDE, which I cannot find a way to do in neovim.</p>
<p>If anyone is considering trying out vim, either to just learn the movement or as a way of abandoning
a graphical IDE which takes like 10 minutes to start up and become usable, I would definitely say
that Neovim and CoC is a perfectly-viable development experience for a web developer using mainly
python.</p>
<p>If you are using Pycharm at the moment, and want to ease the transition to vim, there's a plugin
called IDEAVim which will allow you to use a subset of vim's movement controls within JetBrains IDEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dotfiles">
<h2>Dotfiles</h2>
<p>You can find my <tt class="docutils literal">init.vim</tt> along with a bunch of other dotfiles <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Dvlv/dotfiles">over on github</a></p>
