      <p>My work machine reached End of Life this year, so I got my choice of upgrade. I decided to get the newest ThinkPad X1 Carbon, as they offer Fedora
as an OS choice, and the X1C generally have good reviews and reputation in the Linux world.</p>
<p>Specs are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="linux-compatability">Linux Compatability</h2>
<h3 id="confirmed-working">Confirmed Working:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Bluetooth (Headphones)</li>
<li>Sleep / Suspend (I put the machine to sleep after work at 16:30, and it typically has 91 - 93% the next morning at 08:00)</li>
<li>Keyboard Backlight</li>
<li>Speakers &amp; Microphone</li>
<li>Webcam (More on this below)</li>
<li>Screen Brightness Controls</li>
<li>Trackpad and buttons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="untested">Untested</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fingerprint Reader (I use the machine docked so I have no need for this)</li>
<li>Hibernate (I just sleep the machine or shut it down)</li>
<li>Mobile Internet (I have read that this is not expected to work)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="webcam-support">Webcam Support</h4>
<p>Apparently the X1C can come with two camera options, one of which claims "Computer Vision". This camera apparently will <em>not</em> work on Linux right now. I
only had one option for the camera when building my machine, so I guess they either don't offer that camera in the UK or they stopped using it. The camera in my machine worked fine out-of-the-box.</p>
<h2 id="mini-review">Mini Review</h2>
<p>I never really know what to write for hardware reviews, as I'm much more of a software person. However, I will say that I really like the keyboard on this machine.
My T490s took a little more force to press each key than most machines, and as a result I find I miss quite a few keypresses when typing on it. My Yoga Slim 7i Pro has very soft
keys, and is much nicer to type on. I woudld say the X1C is a nice middle ground between the two, and I have no problems typing on this at all.</p>
<p>The X1C's screen is 1900x1200 and looks great. I think I prefer it to the 2k screen on the Yoga, as that causes weird issues with VMs thinking it's 4k, and I have to enable fractional scaling, which is a bit bleh.</p>
<p>I definitely think 14 inches is the sweet-spot for laptops. 13 feels too small and 15 a bit too big. I have no idea how some of my colleagues lug around 16 inch Macbooks!</p>
<p>The ThinkShutter (privacy cover over the built-in webcam) is a neat idea, and I keep it permanently closed as I have an external cam for meetings.</p>
<h3 id="bad-start">Bad Start?</h3>
<p>I've been reading some horror stories on Hacker News about 12th gen Intel processors, and the X1C 10th Gen itself, but my experience has been flawless out-of-the-box, so I guess either I've been lucky or the problems have been fixed by now.</p>
<p>If you've been reading the same things and are hesitant about the Linux compatability of this machine, I wouldn't worry (assuming you're planning on using an up-to-date distro such as Fedora or Arch. Slower-moving distros like Ubuntu or Mint I cannot speak for).</p>
<h3 id="would-i-recommend-this-laptop">Would I recommend this laptop?</h3>
<p>As I said in my review of the Yoga, we are still in a weird time with laptop hardware. I still think the Apple M1 / M2 machines are probably the best hardware available at the moment. If you can stand to use MacOS, I would
honestly recommend a Macbook Pro. </p>
<p>However, if you're like me and cannot get on with MacOS (or their <em>awful</em> keyboards) then I can say I've had a great first couple of weeks with my X1C running Fedora Silverblue, and I'm glad I waited for it. </p>
