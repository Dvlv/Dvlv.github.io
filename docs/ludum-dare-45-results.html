<p>The Ludum Dare results came in, and I did kinda better than last time.
I have a more detailed breakdown this year so you can see how well I ranked in each category.</p>
<p>My results were:</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: <strong>296</strong> / 512 (3.295 average from 41 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong>: <strong>153</strong> / 512 (3.487 average from 41 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: <strong>442</strong> / 512 (2.538 average from 41 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong>: <strong>317</strong> / 512 (3.184 average from 40 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Graphics</strong>: <strong>469</strong> / 492 (2.321 average from 41 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong>: <strong>316</strong> / 374 (2.694 average from 38 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Humor</strong>: <strong>31</strong> / 378  (3.784 average from 39 ratings)</p>
<p><strong>Mood</strong>: <strong>317</strong> / 475 (2.986 average from 39 ratings)</p>
<p>Woohoo! I broke top 50. And in humour, which is where I tend to focus my writing.</p>
<div class="section" id="where-i-did-well-humour-and-fun">
<h2>Where I did well - Humour and Fun</h2>
<p>Not really surprised my highest category was humour - I put a lot of jokes into the writing of the game. I'm glad people caught on to it though, and I wasn't
expecting to break top 50!</p>
<p>Fun is more surprising, since I wasn't sure how basic platforming and a fairly generic bossfight would stand out against games which are more
focused on their core game loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-i-didn-t-do-so-well-graphics-and-innovation">
<h2>Where I didn't do so well - Graphics and Innovation</h2>
<p>No surprises given my track record for graphics. I had planned to learn Inkscape and make vector grapics this time to hopefully improve
my graphics score, but I gave up very quickly and went back to drawing with a trackball in Gimp.</p>
<p>Innovation is likely low because the gameplay itself wasn't particularly interesting. As I said above - basic platforming and a bossfight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compared-to-last-time">
<h2>Compared to last time</h2>
<p>I had hoped to improve on graphics, but didn't.</p>
<p>Audio is basically the same, and I used the exact same software to produce it, so that makes sense.</p>
<p>I'm glad my Fun and Humour have increased, since that tends to be my main focus.</p>
<p>My plan to ignore story and come up with a gameplay loop instead had crumbled within the first few minutes. I think that's just how my brain works.
I was on the right track with the association with metroidvania games and the theme, but ultimately I went with a funny story over a more
complicated gameplay loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-next">
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>I will try <em>again</em> to fit the theme to a game rather than a story. It's not as easy as it sounds (at least for me).</p>
<p>I may also try to limit the scope of the gameplay in order to limit the amount of art I have to create, allowing me to not wimp-out of
using Inkscape next time.</p>
<p>If I find the time and drive, I would also like to have a look at learning to use LMMS to create some background music. Chrome Music Lab is cool for a free tool, but
I have no idea what I'm really doing with it and it has limited soundclips, so a lot of my background music ends up sounding samey.</p>
